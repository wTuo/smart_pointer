# Description
This is a simple smart pointer implementation, with basic functionality like `std::shared_ptr` in  C++ 11.


Various introduction of `std::shared_ptr`, whether brief or detailed, are easily found in Internet or textbook.
The principle and feature are not enough for beginners. Often, beginners, however, are unwilling to refer to the  source code, which is written with the goal of robustness but difficult to read. 

Thus, this depository aims to provide a **clean implementation** for those beginners who has been fed the principle but want a deep understanding of `std::shared_ptr` from simple and specific implementation.
